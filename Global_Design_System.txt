NEXTCLASS Global Design System

This document defines the complete visual language of the NEXTCLASS platform.

Primary Font: Manrope
All text across the application must use this font family.

Typographic Scale: Adhere to Tailwind CSS standard scale
Examples:
- text-5xl font-bold for H1
- text-lg for body copy

Student UI Panels: "Frosted Glass" Effect
CSS class: 'bg-white/20 backdrop-blur-xl rounded-lg'
This creates a semi-transparent, modern look that feels motivational and engaging.

Teacher UI Panels: High-Contrast, Opaque, Professional Style
CSS class: 'bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg'
This provides a data-rich, professional interface focused on actionable insights.

Interactivity:
All interactive elements (buttons, links) must have clear hover and focus states with smooth transitions.
Buttons should have a subtle scale transform on hover (e.g., hover:scale-105).

Animation:
UI elements should load and transition with subtle, non-intrusive animations to enhance the user experience and provide visual feedback.
Recommended animations:
- fade-in: For content appearing
- slide-up: For panels and cards
- scale transforms: For interactive feedback
